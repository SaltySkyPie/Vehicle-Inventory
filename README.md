# Vehicle Inventory

## Description

This is a simple vehicle inventory application. It is a monorepo with a NestJS backend and a Next.js frontend.

## Installation

Installations instructions are in the README.md files in the backend and frontend directories.

If you wish you wish to setup database locally, you can use the docker-compose.yml file in the environment directory. Instructions are in the README.md file in the environment directory.

## Note

I didn't bother too much to do proper version control. If you'd like to see how I usually do it, checkout my most recent project [repo](https://gitlab.com/SaltySkyPie/blog-app)
